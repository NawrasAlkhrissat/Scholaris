## 💡 About the Project

**Scholaris** was born out of the need to modernize traditional school administration. Many institutions still rely on fragmented data (Excel sheets, paper records), leading to communication gaps and security risks.

**Scholaris** solves this by providing a unified web-based ecosystem that digitizes student records, automates daily workflows (attendance, grading), and ensures data integrity through secure, role-based access.

### 🚀 Why Scholaris?
- **Efficiency:** Replaces manual paperwork with one-click digital solutions.
- **Transparency:** Parents receive real-time updates, eliminating end-of-semester surprises.
- **Security:** Advanced encryption strategies to protect sensitive student data.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Scholaris follows a **Modular MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to ensure separation of concerns and scalability.

![System Architecture](assets/architecture.png) The database is designed with **MongoDB** to handle complex relationships between Students, Classes, and Academic Records efficiently.

## 🔒 Security Implementation

Security was a primary focus during the development of Scholaris. Key measures include:

1.  **Password Protection (Bcrypt & Salting):**
    - Implemented a robust hashing strategy using **Salt rounds**.
    - Prevents **Rainbow Table Attacks**; even if two users have the same password (e.g., `123456`), their stored hashes are completely different.

2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - Strict middleware ensures `Students` cannot access `Teacher` routes, and `Teachers` cannot modify `Admin` settings.

3.  **Data Integrity:**
    - Server-side validation to prevent logic errors (e.g., grades > 100).

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

I am actively working on the next phase of Scholaris:

- [ ] **Frontend Migration:** Rebuilding the UI with **React.js** for a Single Page Application (SPA) experience.
- [ ] **Mobile App:** Developing a cross-platform app using **React Native**.
- [ ] **AI Integration:** Implementing predictive analytics for student performance.
